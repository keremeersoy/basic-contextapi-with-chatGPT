I asked chatgpt to make me a simple example that I can create with context api. First he showed me the most basic usage. I asked for more enhancements and he made me an enhancement where I could enter name and age and add data. Afterwards, I said that I wanted to add css to this application and I used the css codes he offered me. So this is the first time I have used chatgpt for educational purposes and I am amazed at what it can do.
